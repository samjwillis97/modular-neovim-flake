# TODO

- Get debugger working for typescript
- Check copilot mode is correct
- grab completion stuff from kickstart
- try freeze.nvim again
- git hunk navigation
- evalute neotree OR try and change hl group of nvim-tree so its not so dark
    - looks as if this supports opening as a floating window
    - and changing background hl_group
